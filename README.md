Prerequisites
  Please ensure Unity 5 + is installed 
  Functions with Windows but if using Mac please ensure that you check files before editing the project
Running
  The scenes are loacted in Assets>Scenes and Dev is the main scene 
  The game should run fine with all the prefab settings saved although if issues are apparent then use prefabs to rebuild the     scene
  Deployment
    Building to multiple platforms should not be problematic however if building to mobile please consider if any scaling factors need to considered - this aspect still needs testing
